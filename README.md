### Abstract
 I decided to make the Coin Ranking app to use the new technologies of Android and improve myself. When I started doing this application, there were technologies that I used for the first time. This situation forced me a lot. I got involved in continuous research and received help from various question and answer platforms. I would like to thank everyone separately. I am sharing this project with you as open source. If you have a chance to review the code structure, don't forget to send your advice to me. When I finished this project, I learned very good experiences. This made me very happy. Now I started to roll up my sleeves to start my next project.

### Project Details
In this Coin Ranking app, using the Coin Ranking API, I enabled all cryptocurrencies to be displayed. When one of the cryptocurrencies clicked, I provided the history of the chart with the details. I used the MPA library while doing this. We can also add to favorites when we go into details.

### How Can I Use
If you want to use this project, all you have to do is 
```
/data/ApiService/
@Headers("Your API KEY")
```
you can follow this path and use the API you obtained from RapidApi or [CoinRanking](https://coinranking.com/).
